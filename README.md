## Dependencies

The notebook uses numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn libraries

## Project Motivation

The goal of the project was to analyze standardized test scores for California and create a model to predict
these from school demographic data. Bias in the model was removed by removing features that have inherent
bias such as gender, ethnicity, economic status etc.
